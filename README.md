# ReSculpt - "Turning Waste into Opportunity"

ReSculpt addresses the growing problem of waste in our society, which negatively impacts both people and animals. The issue arises from our fast-paced consumption and disposal habits, particularly with single-use items. Traditional waste management methods further exacerbate the problem. Our mission is to revolutionize waste handling by transforming household items into new, useful products. This approach not only benefits the environment but also allows us to create unique and functional items for our homes.

## Features

**1) Upload Requirements:**
- After logging in, artisans can easily upload their material requirements.
- For instance, if an artisan needs 10kg of plastic, they can fill out a simple form on the upload page specifying their needs for creating innovative products.

**2) Visibility to Users:**
- Uploaded requirements are visible to all users.
- If a user has the requested material, such as plastic bottles, they can use the 'Contribute' button to offer their waste.

**3) Contribution Process:**
- Contributors' waste is collected by a delivery agent from their doorstep once the artisan's requirement is fulfilled.
- The collected waste is then delivered to the artisan's location after successful payment.

**4) Innovative Product Creation:**
- Upon receiving the contributed waste, artisans can use it to craft innovative products.
- These products can be easily uploaded to the marketplace through the app for selling.
